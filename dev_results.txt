417	Okay ? - We're not dead yet ?	4
418	I don't say that with any kind of blame or accusation , but that is when it started .	6
419	Did you really think he would come with you ?	7
420	I've never felt more alive in my whole life .	4
421	What ? Get off my coat !	8
422	The question is what are you doing here ?	1
423	Perhaps that's why I'm incapable of having a child .	6
424	Cody , wait !	2
425	It is well .	1
426	If that horse would run tomorrow ,	1
427	There's my favourite little boy .	5
428	I'm trying to clean up the party . Our party . And I end up speaking out of turn .	1
429	So alone .	8
430	And don't try anything funny , cos you know what you'll get .	2
431	He says it's dangerous to spend the night in the village .	1
432	Everything's so clean . Everybody's so nice .	5
433	He was trying to stop it .	1
434	I think I've finally found a sport I like .	5
435	Somebody will listen to me .	1
436	My mommy hurt my head .  	4
437	Has decided to demolish ...	1
438	You look so cool !	5
439	My very best friends .	8
440	Give a girl a chance to breathe .	2
441	They're armed .	1
442	And it's a miracle old [PERSON]'s alive today .	7
443	Stole my Tintoretto . and my [PERSON] . And it has taken all [PERSON]'s bronze [LOCATION] the Countess .	3
444	I could have saved time and liquor by doing this in my office , but it needs a little ceremony .	2
445	It's dangerous jouncing Mrs. [PERSON] over open country .	4
446	My unit's due to be shipped out soon .	2
447	In which case , you'd be throwing out decades of disarmament progress .	1
448	Prisoner has a right to escape , hasn't he ?	4
449	Don't worry , kid !	8
450	You know ... Sometimes I even amaze myself .	8
451	I'd give my soul to go , but I can't .	8
452	You're not just a crook , but a murderer .	3
453	He's still emotionally unstable .	1
454	I'm sure you'll need them if you're gonna go into rats in detail .	8
455	You shut up , Dude , and listen to me .	1
456	Right there ... in those big blue eyes .	8
457	That's right .	8
458	Morphine syrette . Give me a morphine syrette . I got it .	2
459	I broke my glasses .	1
460	Welcome to [LOCATION] , ma'am .	8
461	You're nuts !	1
462	Myself . When I am in possession of my faculties and [PERSON] is not .	1
463	It made a thief of [PERSON] , a pig out of [PERSON] and a fool of you .	1
464	Well , it should be a pretty smooth flight . The weather's clear to [LOCATION] .	5
465	Your famous [PERSON] is safe .	8
466	You are dead inside .	4
467	Am I sure ?	8
468	I am the avenger .	1
469	No , no , no , I don't mean that .	1
470	It hurts me when people laugh at you .	5
471	But I had locked the briefcase of the [PERSON] in the morning following to her death .	4
472	I can't seem to keep you two out of the hospital lately .	6
473	I do not like Mr. [PERSON] .	2
474	I killed this person for their money , right ?	4
475	Thank you , Mr. [PERSON] .	8
476	Cheese doodles !	2
477	Maybe we'll get lucky .	2
478	They're here .	1
479	He never even heard of [PERSON] .	2
480	I rehearse my story . I try to think of all the questions they'll ask .	1
481	Hey , you know me .	2
482	Before proceeding further , I'll remind the visitors in the gallery that they are here as our guests and should conduct themselves as such .	2
483	What's the idea of turning her down ?	1
484	Well , now , there's a lovable chap .	1
485	Let me out , or I'll kill myself .	4
486	We're realists , knowing that we're on the outside looking in . - We calmly accept our uncertain position . - Yeah .	8
487	I killed her ! I killed her like she was an animal .	3
488	At my age , corrected by an illiterate .	3
489	There's some hot biscuits in the warmer .	5
490	[PERSON] , what the hell have you done to the coffee ?	1
491	The clerk will call the roll .	5
492	I'm getting darned sick of the way she's acting .	3
493	You do not deny , then , that such a monster could exist . Is that correct ?	4
494	If I was you , I would go home and talk to your family people .	1
495	Interesting problem we got on this one :	4
496	Their privilege , their presumption .	1
497	Think I'm a fool ?	3
498	m glad for you . 	5
499	[PERSON]'s looking for a new assistant and wants to meet you for a drink .	2
500	Oh , you little beauty !	5
501	[PERSON] , don't try it .	1
502	We got ta stick together , cos what are we ?	8
503	By the way ...	1
504	What'd he die of ?	6
505	She got what she deserves .	2
506	Yes ? What is it ?	8
507	She seemed too restless , too tense , too withdrawn , and [PERSON] , when he wasn't looking at [PERSON] , he was watching [LOCATION] look at Maria .	6
508	Just get out of my house .	1
509	He attacked your bitch .	1
510	Emergency speed , all engines !	4
511	Ready to celebrate ?	2
512	I know what you're going to say .	1
513	However , just at the moment , I have drinking to do .	2
514	It's not that easy to kill someone and get away with it .	4
515	I'm glad for the company .	5
516	It's yours , I want you to have it . It's for you .	2
517	It's Nobel Prize juice . Set sail for home , for [LOCATION] !	2
518	I've got some job possibilities for you .	8
519	I'll get some help !	8
520	Are you trying to kill me ?	4
521	It stung at first , but now I can't feel a thing .	6
522	I'll ... bet the size of the pot .	2
523	We're that kind of monster .	4
524	I'm going home . I - I'm not well .	1
525	It's funny , she didn't mention a husband .	7
526	Champagne !	5
527	Don't you get it ?	1
528	When does it leave ?	1
529	I did it , bro .	7
530	Aren't you human ?	2
531	She's alright . She's better than before .	1
532	That's how it looks in my report unless you've got something to change it .	2
533	What bothers you ?	1
534	Stop fidgeting .	1
535	Mayii : I had long since lost track Of the child [PERSON] .	4
536	Thank you for using ATT .	8
537	I wanted to look mellow and I look brittle .	2
538	Bye , Commander .	5
539	They're not putting up the money .	1
540	Oh , your parents should be ashamed of themselves	3
541	Well , that's the problem . Um ... The bad guys took it .	3
542	You'll meet him shortly .	2
543	Frank . The Benzedrine's got my teeth wiggling .	3
544	Don't look at me .	1
545	Is that so far from your desire ?	1
546	[PERSON] dam is a fraud .	2
547	Ghosts ?	1
548	I'm broke .	6
549	[LOCATION] has done the impossible .	7
550	I know how this city degrades the individual .	8
551	Now let him win it back !	2
552	It's gonna be awkward , but this kid comes first .	2
553	The State calls Detective [PERSON] .	1
554	I order all ghosts to be expelled !	1
555	I see that it's funny .	7
556	Are you off your trolley ?	1
557	Tonight , we go and make party .	2
558	I'm having friends in on Wednesday for dinner and drinks .	2
559	I just hose them off , if she gets on them .	1
560	You want to work for somebody else ? - No .	8
561	Actually , we wanted to do some remodeling first .	1
562	Please sit down , sober up .	8
563	He can't be your friend .	8
564	Now , look . You're a vaguely amusing and not unattractive guy , but I'm not even remotely interested .	1
565	Shoot it !	1
566	You look like death .	3
567	The devil is always waiting in the shadows .  	1
568	Get the legs .	1
569	Very well .	1
570	Do you drink this stuff ? No .	2
571	Or a liar .	1
572	You know , for a minute , that [PERSON] almost had me convinced I was wrong .	4
573	We come from a good family My name is Windy	8
574	I think that about covers it for now .	1
575	Don't lose no sweat , Kid .	3
576	Who's afraid of a little booger ?	4
577	Because I watched [PERSON] go through exactly what you're going through right now .	1
578	You just wait .	2
579	I went off because I gained like six pounds ,	5
580	I have improved it .	8
581	We're fools to tolerate it .	3
582	Are you confessing to this ?	1
583	Assuming that the captain's conduct often showed bad judgement . - - Would that be inconsistent with your diagnosis of him ?	6
584	You're gonna need weapons , all of you .	4
585	[PERSON] wrote something awful nice .	6
586	Wait !	2
587	For your next fight , try the redhead in the front row .	1
588	I didn't get a chance to tell him .	1
589	Such personal questions are not appropriate .	1
590	Good - bye , [PERSON] .	5
591	[PERSON] talked him out of it .	1
592	You pulled them all off me , you stupid son of a bitch .	1
593	You're alive !	4
594	This is most evil of all .	1
595	You go find it .	1
596	Let's go to some other place .	2
597	Mes dames et messieurs , good night !	5
598	What do you mean , if anything happens to you ?	4
599	Do you have any experience ?	2
600	I guess [PERSON]'s got more sense than both of us .	8
601	I'm very excited , [PERSON] .	5
602	What's the latest ?	1
603	Where did she get a bag to match those shoes ?	7
604	Why should I answer ?	1
605	Now there's a thought ....	7
606	That's the fairest drink of whiskey you'll ever throw lip over , boy .	8
607	You've got to be realistic .	2
608	For God's sakes , put yourself in my position .	1
609	This time , you won't get away with it .	1
610	We never miss .	6
611	I'm very pleased to meet you , sister [PERSON] .	4
612	The others are getting suspicious .	2
613	I'm telling you , she won't marry me !	2
614	I want coconut .	2
615	I love the boy , Neddie .	5
616	Let's keep our eyes peeled for camp site .	2
617	Nobody knows anything about what's happening here .	1
618	They have to find you , do it cleanly , without ... drawing attention to themselves .	2
619	Not a happy one .	5
620	I said ... Burn in hell !	1
621	With all the contributions of the Sea Hawks ... we can not possibly match [PERSON]'s vast resources .	1
622	You hit me again and I'm gonna rip your face off .	4
623	Like I'd ever tell you .	1
624	You can't guarantee our luggage !	1
625	You wan na help her with the stuff ?	2
626	Tell me this is about something .	2

629	Leader , party just got bigger .	1
630	Look . Look ! Look !	2
631	I can't afford a fuckin' dream house !	3
632	You only pretended to be my friend .	1
633	You skin will look and feel a whole lot better .	2
634	I want to feel my bones burst into a billion pieces !	8
635	You're not going to hang me ?	2
636	You may have overlooked the fact that the use of officers for labour is expressly forbidden by the Geneva Convention .	1
637	If that's what the grown - ups have done with this world , we have to start those boys ' camps and see what the kids can do .	8
638	You think I'll let her out when you'll have her around people like [PERSON] ?	2
639	That's not music .	2
640	You're late , maricón .	4
641	Why do you want to kill all my friends ?	1
642	[PERSON]'s son used to sneak up these stairs to go to the roof , play [PERSON] to his friends .	8
643	You told [PERSON] ?	1
644	Thanks , baby .	8
645	I like to read .	2
646	You'll see better what I mean through this .	1
647	He said that to scare us .	4
648	Maybe I can help you to get out of it .	8
649	Saint Deus . What she said ?	1
650	Ten suicides there was last year , in one day .	6
651	You can depend on me for an additional overcall of 250 .	3
652	Try this piece of poetry .	3
653	Is that all right with you ?	8
654	Nice questions you ask .	1
655	I'd say you were the only man I ever loved .	6
656	It had to be filled with love .	5
657	How much simpler it would be , for so many of us , if [PERSON] had not found it necessary to look for a new face .	2
658	There were some problems with ...	4
659	Do you mean he'd never seen a clock before ?	7
660	You couldn't leave your girl ?	6
661	This time it is you who does not understand . I know [PERSON] better than you do .	8
662	Rushing home to a hot apartment to listen to the automatic laundry and the electric dishwasher and the garbage disposal and the nagging wife .	4
663	That dated us , all right , but it gave us something to do .	5
664	Crazy out of your skull .	1
665	Die , you bastard !	6
666	I didn't jump .	6
667	The point is of no return ... and you've reached it !	1
668	What do you mean something struck her ?	7
669	I want you to take care of someone for me .	8
670	There's nothing I can do about squabbles in the imperial court	3
671	But , God , people can be rude .	3
672	Come on , [PERSON] !	2
673	Feel better ?	5
674	So I hit the casino floor , I'm walking out , heart's in my mouth .	3
675	Where is [PERSON] ?	1
676	I'm sorry , Rock .	6
677	You mean to say I have this all to myself ?	1
678	Maybe we can go get a drink ?	2
679	How about a nice mango [LOCATION] cooler ?	5
680	Good boy , good boy .	5
681	[PERSON] , it's getting late .	4
682	You'll make no calls .	8
683	That's great .	5
684	But we have a hotplate and a well - stocked refrigerator .	4
685	He'll be a champ .	8
686	Look out !	2
687	No ! There's no place like home .	2
688	Maybe this goddamn bastard of an election will get itself resolved .	3
689	I'll give you a minute and seconds .	2
690	Whatever your love wishes me to be , whatever is in your heart .	6
691	No , these are mine , I gave you money .	1
692	We're being wiped out !	1
693	I just thought I'd drop by and cheer you up a bit .	5
694	Hurry up !	2
695	What the fuck you talkin' about ?	1
696	If I told you what we've been through ...	1
697	We're just the guys to do it .	1
698	No , you mustn't !	2
699	In front of millions . That didn't stop [PERSON] . [PERSON] , remember ...	7
700	It's for your own good .	5
701	I'll see you tomorrow .	2
702	You know what I'm talking about and so does everybody on this set .	8
703	It's a bit humiliating , always borrowing [PERSON]'s place .	1
704	What's the occasion ?	1
705	Join my class ?	2
706	You darling , [PERSON] !	8
707	Do you accuse me , Mr. [PERSON] ?	1
708	Nice meeting you .	5
709	Just look at her . Look at the size of her .	1
710	Nobody knows what goes on inside a police car , right , [PERSON] ?	8
711	That's out of our jurisdiction , isn't it ?	7
712	What kind of an answer is that against a $ million world gross ? You don't say .	6
713	The suspect's body , who we now believe is our Jack the Ripper copycat , was discovered late last night .	6
714	If we push this , who are we pushing against ?	1
715	I don't want any more of it .	1
716	I don't wan na go like this .	1
717	The bus , the bus !	1
718	Are you suggesting that I killed those women ?	1
719	Then you weren't angry because I wasn't there ?	6
720	It'll put you right in the mood .	2
721	I've no other place to go .	1
722	An odd coincidence , both of you turning up here .	4
723	I failed you .	1
724	I do not hide the truth .	8
725	I don't want to die .	6
726	Well , if you want anything , just ring .	1
727	I didn't hear no bell !	7
728	It hasn't been all that pleasant for you , has it Mr. [PERSON] ?	3
729	I'm in the shithouse .	1
730	The kid hates me .	1
731	I've been trying to find you , but ...	1
732	Ask him how we'll get outta here .	1
733	That's a good thing to know , [PERSON] .	8
734	Stop , please .	4
735	Inside there's a huge creature	2
736	No , please , no !	4
737	Sorry I was suspicious .	6
738	You're in great danger .	5
739	There'll be a slight delay .	2
740	Wasn't he that shop's bill collector ?	6
741	What are we going to do about the bed scene ?	1
742	What's killing the children ?	4
743	I should say not .	1
744	You're gonna get the shakes soon , [PERSON] .	2
745	I'm engaged .	2
746	By next Friday , you'll have your money .	2
747	You stay away from my baby .	1
748	A [PERSON] saved my life . I just wanted to buy 'em a beer to thank 'em .	8
749	Sends her love .	5
750	What are you smilin' at ?	1
751	You run into him on the daisy chain you tell him I want to see him . Comprende ?	2
752	I'm gonna take you to a nice , quiet place .	2
753	Now you want to give him another ?	2
754	You don't even know him !	1
755	Can't be worth more than francs .	1
756	I'll pay both of you .	2
757	She believes that her father has incestuous desires .	8
758	Both those guys on the trailer are in it .	2
759	Why didn't you write to me ?	7
760	Could you send up champagne and strawberries ? Of course .	1
761	Oh , I almost forgot .	7
762	There's no more running .	1
763	And it's the truth , of course .	8
764	Don't let it beat you .	1
765	I don't see any reason why this witness should not be qualified to give evidence .	1
766	Soon we will expand from city to city .	2
767	But the neighbours will know we've adopted .	8
768	It all began one night when the lights went out. ,	2
769	I'll see if I can get through .	2
770	Let's drink to something .	2
771	There's something terrible happening in there .	6
772	It is infernal !	1
773	Don't have bad dreams .	3
774	All engines ahead full .	8
775	Spring's gonna be early .	2
776	Thank you for stopping , you saved my life !	8
777	Simply gorgeous .	5
778	What can I do for you ?	1
779	I thought I knew all of Grandpa's friends but I don't seem to recognize you .	5
780	Who would want to live in a graveyard ?	1
781	What did [PERSON] say to get you so upset ?	1
782	I don't know where I'd be with this bill if it wasn't for your help .	6
783	Whoever it was The family honor him [PERSON] prevent flaunt it .	6
784	His body and clothes soaked in blood ?	3
785	Suppose I could prove it to you . Suppose I asked you for your help . Would you give it to me , without telling anybody , not saying anything to anyone ?	4
786	Does it mean you want me to go there ?	2
787	Don't call me commander .	1
788	Go ! Go !	1
789	Profane , or really offensive ?	1
790	I'm just curious .	1
791	All right , is that a beautiful city or what ?	5
792	There was no way I could get in touch with my husband .	3
793	You think you're pretty smart , don't you ?	3
794	You'll not take her while I live !	1
795	Dangerous . Probably a serial killer .	1
796	For being the biggest dickhead I ever went out with .	7
797	When was the last time you saw her ?	6
798	I'm rich enough .	1
799	I will never forget his face when we entered in the room of the Mrs. [PERSON] .	1
800	How'd you like to have [PERSON] for a mother ? Or [PERSON] ?	1
801	That puts quite a burden on the company .	7
802	He'll kill me if he has to .	4
803	This is real nice .	5
804	Don't listen to her !	1
805	I declare , [PERSON] , sometimes I think you got psychic powers .	2
806	The odds against survival in this camp are even worse .	4
807	That's odd .	1
808	What do you say , cousin ?	1
809	That's normal . That's what she should be doing .	7
810	Hey , Beef , if [PERSON] says the van was empty , the van was empty .	7
811	It's gonna be a massacre .	2
812	Destroy everything ?	1
813	And you are definitely not insane .	1
814	Is too much heat almost , it is not ?	1
815	What's that got to do with it ?	2
816	Assure [PERSON] that he'll be in our prayers .	2
