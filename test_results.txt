415	I wanted to blame myself even for the man who had taken me .	1
416	You've no right to think what you do about me .	8
417	It is not usually he writes to me .	2
418	Now , listen , stow the chatter , mate , and get on that banjo .	2
419	Amine , can you hear me ?	1
420	[PERSON] , we've got a serious problem .	4
421	But I can order with the best of 'em .	5
422	What he did was , he just took my money .	7
423	I'm an old man who will live until I die .	6
424	Any guy who says he can fence $ 50,000 , is crazy .	1
425	All I'm saying is maybe all the child needs is to be loved .	2
426	That Miss [PERSON] is about the prettiest girl I ever did see .	7
427	How do I know you'll jump ?	2
428	And that's why I don't wan na talk about it if I don't have to .	1
429	That old man is a sick character .	3
430	Admiral know what that is ?	8
431	You see how much we accomplish when you appear ?	2
432	The Cold War is over , Mrs. Acting President .	4
433	That should give you the real overview of where we're headed .	3
434	I hope you have a nice stay in [LOCATION] .	2
435	Anyway , the president of this teamster local back east set up a phony welfare fund , right ?	4
436	She ain't gonna talk , man .	1
437	That was incredible .	7
438	Please I don't want anyone to be bad to my wife .	4
439	You got ta get them bones growing .	1
440	Did somebody say chase  ? 	7
441	You should have a kid , [PERSON] .	1
442	Silence , [PERSON] !	3
443	What happened ? Where are the others ?	7
444	It's gonna be very dangerous .	4
445	Is this our new car ?	2
446	I forgot about it .	1
447	I wonder what he's doing with Mr [PERSON] .	5
448	Now , your gallant Maj. [PERSON] is selling me a phony . So he deserves whatever he gets .	3
449	Come on , [PERSON] . We got ta move !	2
450	Probably not .	2
451	Maryk showed me a log he had written on [PERSON]'s behaviour .	8
452	Oh , no , don't worry about me .	4
453	Humans are dumb .	3
454	Who reported it ?	1
455	Rock , go !	5
456	Ted , thanks .	8
457	Carry on , men .	1
458	Skinny popped him .	1
459	I might get bit , after all .	1
460	Hey ! It's [PERSON] .	1
461	[PERSON] would get a shot every half hour so he could die without pain .	6
462	You've always had to work ?	1
463	Yeah . Just call me . - When ?	1
464	Good luck , Mom .	8
465	She's a wonderful wife to me , too .	5
466	I won't let it happen .	2
467	But come sit for a minute .	1
468	The sunsets were pink ...	1
469	Tri Face !	1
470	I - I took some sleeping pills .	1
471	Oh my God !	7
472	It hurts , hurts , hurts .	1
473	You're the experts .	8
474	You will be cooperative ?	1
475	I feel I should be doing something , but I don't know what .	6
476	Give me that !	1
477	Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law .	1
478	In six months , we'll have the finest drill team in the world .	8
479	Fucking cannibal .	1
480	Barney ! [PERSON] , what a day .	2
481	I got a hunch [PERSON] ain't got his mind on his business .	1
482	Neighbors like each other , speak to each other , care if anybody lives or dies .	4
483	I'd really like to help you .	8
484	Because I'm still tired .	6
485	But at least try my way first .	1
486	You know , you're expecting too much from that formula of B - 4 , Mr Oxly .	2
487	I like doing business with a man I can trust .	8
488	I get to live in a place ... it's OK . Don't get me wrong . The air is clean .	1
489	That's great , eh ?	5
490	That does it .	2
491	I don't want her hurt at all .	1
492	Yours ?	1
493	What ? !	1
494	It was a pleasure to have the general here .	5
495	If it's new committee assignments you'd like , we can certainly arrange that .	2
496	Look , your mother is here .	1
497	We've had wonderful times , we three .	5
498	We should celebrate this with a bottle of wine .	2
499	I find it really insulting that you assume it has to be a guy .	3
500	But it's not real .	2
501	For God's sake , listen to me !	1
502	Look what I found !	2
503	She must've struck something .	7
504	I appreciate that , sir .	8
505	Boys forget what their country means by just reading  Land of the Free  in history books .	2
506	If only you knew how anxious I am to talk to you .	1
507	Great view . I bet you can see all the way to the ocean from out here .	5
508	I couldn't do anything .	4
509	I shot him .	1
510	They hurt you any , [PERSON] ?	1
511	[PERSON] , this is Al.	8
512	Nobody can do that , ... Except you .	1
513	Was a [N-WORD] ?	1
514	What that child got to stand , the good Lord give her strength to stand .	5
515	Did you see that ?	7
516	We have a tremendous audience here At global television studios ,	1
517	Anyway , what's it matter to you ?	1
518	Look , there's something weird going on here , and I can't quite follow it .	8
519	But , she can be very generous sometimes .	5
520	It's high time I told [PERSON] a thing or two .	1
521	It's a deal .	1
522	And the only way we got of holding 'em off is by getting together .	8
523	I mean , all you have to do is to step aside with immense fortune .	5
524	Without a wind , we'll lose him !	2
525	This is true , [PERSON] .	8
526	It will happen , as it does for all of us .	2
527	It affects her every day .	1
528	You're the first good thing that's happened to us .	5
529	We'll make the deal .	8
530	Outstanding .	7
531	I do not know what you are , but you are not a woman .	2
532	Listen , I really can't talk about this over the phone .	1
533	Where were you ?	1
534	I don't give a damn .	1
535	I don't know . We just ... became friends . And then it became more than that .	8
536	That'll stop him !	1
537	Now , the police are gonna want me to let some of you go as a sign of good faith .	2
538	You lose the feel of the cards when you have so much action ... day in and day out .	2
539	Ever since the club split up , I missed you . We all missed you .	4
540	Did you sleep well ?	7
541	C'mon , rest awhile girl .	2
542	As I said , sir it all depends how far we're willing to go .	8
543	I'm tired .	6
544	I've never been happier in my life .	5
545	Junior !	1
546	Well , I want to thank you and your wife for all your help .	8
547	We're counting on you .	2
548	Aren't you ever satisfied ?	1
549	No , no , no , no , no , I want to know what the hell is happening to me !	1
550	Before the bomb went off yesterday , do you recall seeing this man ?	7
551	I hope you'll enjoy this .	8
552	We'll share it .	8
553	So , I guess I was the lucky one .	5
554	I'm sorry you have to sneak out by the back way , but we must preserve a respectable front .	3
555	One can learn a great deal from him .	5
556	Don't be tricked by his devilish voice !	1
557	What good is it to cut off your heads ?	5
558	Sorry , coach .	6
559	Not going to do it .	1
560	This is nice .	5
561	They ain't going to expedite it for me .	1
562	We came outside giddy and reeling .	2
563	Good job .	5
564	I'm glad you told me about this .	5
565	I decline to answer your question . I decline to answer your question .	1
566	And I know this planet is safer because she's defending it .	8
567	My point is there is a protocol with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children .	6
568	Don't question my decisions again .	1
569	I know it's a silly thing for me to ask you , but I want you to tell me the truth .	8
570	No luck ?	1
571	It's tough being left out , isn't it ?	6
572	Don't ask me why .	1
573	He was very understanding .	8
574	She's going to die if you don't help me .	6
575	Now come on , you've been drinking .	2
576	Why did you lie to me ?	7
577	If you become president , would [PERSON] remain as vice president ?	1
578	Did you bring that guy in here ?	1
579	They've done things with my body and the bodies of others ...	1
580	I was in a really bad place .	7
581	Hey Pops , give me one of those crazy beers .	1
582	Cheers , man .	5
583	Yeah , are you gonna feed her ?	8
584	Just give me the stamp . I love you , [PERSON] , [PERSON] , [PERSON] , [PERSON] , whatever your name is .	5
585	So why don't you tell me a little about yourself ?	1
586	I'll be in my office if you need me .	2
587	This is long , man .	1
588	To me , man is a tremendous creation , an inconceivable thought .	7
589	You sound further away than that .	7
590	So , how is it you know so little about cars ?	2
591	We have an idea that might help .	8
592	[PERSON] is army from the anus up .	1
593	I had no right to put you through all that .	8
594	What's [PERSON] got to do with this ?	2
595	What about it ?	1
596	I get two bucks an hour , plus ten per cent of that goes to a bail fund .	1
597	Must be very good .	5
598	You really could be a nun ! Thanks .	5
599	Then when I'm good and ready , we come out with a big extra .	2
600	Collaborating with President [PERSON] is always a mistake .	8
601	Did you see what he did ?	7
602	Sink that longboat !	1
603	Thank you for asking .	8
604	How did you manage to get so friendly with [PERSON] ?	8
605	Did I hear something about jewels ?	2
606	Father .	1
607	I don't like your faces .	3
608	Well , now where are you going ?	1
609	Your back prevented you from practicing six hours a day .	2
610	If I don't get a room , you and your hotel are fourth on my list to be sued !	1
611	No worries .	8
612	Fracture that whole part of the world , and now we have ISIS .	7
613	I knew there was a story in that guy .	5
614	So , the ring ? - No .	8
615	Sing something , [PERSON] . Wonderful idea !	5
616	I have no basis and no standing to move forward if I did .	2
617	They're poorly !	6
618	I'll get on it first thing .	1
619	I am going to throw up .	1
620	Well , as long as you feel that way about it , the gun is yours !	4
621	Jesus ... - Christ on a crutch .	1
622	Get ready . We need you to drop something off .	2
623	Okay , I need you to calm down , okay ?	8
624	I've been having weather problems .	4
625	Whatever action needs to be taken to address this problem , needs to be taken .	1
626	I'm just following orders But don't worry	8
627	So , should we still listen to what Elder says ?	1
628	She'll talk about the Triad robbery , she'll name Case , then us .	2
629	But right now , I can't think of one .	8
630	Please . - Could you get [PERSON] a Coke , please ? - Sure .	4
631	What's so odd about that ?	1
632	What do you skin ?	3
633	How long has she been gone ? ! How long ?	6
634	I won't ever do it again , I promise .	8
635	I'm not kiddin' around .	1
636	Stay out of sight .	1
637	Be ready to leave on the night train for [LOCATION] .	2
638	Why would a dumb Polack like you think he could outsmart someone like me ?	7
639	I'm just fine .	5
640	Because she can't stand him !	1
641	I'm your man . Come anywhere near my old lady , I'll cut your balls off , asshole .	3
642	One good thing .	5
643	I mean , about my having this floor to go on with my babbling .	1
644	You took away my czar , my country , my people .	3
645	I asked him especially , and he told me to tell you .	1
646	Do you expect me to believe this ?	7
647	I don't think you'll be able to stand it long .	1
648	Well , the tall guy is not really a friend .	8
649	He tried to knife me .	1
650	Can I just leave my underwear ?	1
651	Well , I must say you're quite different from what I expected .	7
652	Get away from that wood !	1
653	I'm clearing out of that office everything I own .	8
654	I think you're all being unfair .	1
655	If they do come here , you will let me know ?	2
656	Okay . All right !	8
657	Not even a perhaps or a maybe ?	6
658	Sounds right to me . OK .	8
659	Beautiful . - Uh-huh . Yeah .	5
660	We've to get out of here and get help !	8
661	We'll have to hope that that's enough .	2
662	Mr. [PERSON] ? You all right ?	8
663	We lost [PERSON] !	1
664	You are a class - A fuck - up , you know ?	1
665	Something I can do to help you ?	8
666	I saw those guys coming towards [PERSON]'s house just before we got out .	2
667	I mean you're gonna find it kind of hard to drive without any keys .	3
668	I'm gonna do it now .	2
669	Not me .	1
670	You're sure of that , are you ?	8
671	On !	1
672	How many times have I told you to keep away from my desk ?	6
673	I'm coming to you .	2

675	What about us ?	1
676	Don't you believe it .	7

678	Your gutless hide is safe .	3
679	How does he end his letter ?	1
680	Here , rally round and I'll show you the points of interest .	2
681	I want to talk to my brothers .	1
682	With a ring like that I could , dare I say it , rule the world .	1
683	He's a good man .	5
684	Not your fault , don't think that .	6
685	And ten minutes later I got the call ... that the court had found in our favor .	2
686	What kind of car ?	2
687	You conning him out of the deed without putting down a cent .	1
688	Yeah , you fucking coward !	1

690	Listen , I got an idea .	1
691	Isn't this the same desk ... ?	1
692	Please . Understand I was taken by surprise .	4
693	No , sir .	8

706	He'll show you when it's finished .	2
707	She was worried about you .	8
708	A little early for Christmas shopping , ain't it ?	5
709	You'll never get me to give this up !	2
710	It's not exactly the Ritz , but it's peaceful and quiet .	1
711	You little spying ' hyena . Did the professor put you up to this ?	2
712	Sort of .	7
713	You make me sick when you speak , [PERSON] .	3
714	But we've got to take a closer look at this big boy .	2
715	The best , smartest , most interesting women in the world ?	5
716	No need to worry , son .	8
717	Come on , it's me , [PERSON] .	2
718	Why would anyone recognize me ?	7

720	You broke your husband out of prerelease ?	6
721	What the blaze is going on here ?	1
722	I hate that cheap little bastard .	3
723	But , of course , she's lying .	3
724	Well , it can't be helped now .	8
725	Very nice , [PERSON] .	5
726	And treat those two impostors Just the same ...  	3
727	You know this guy !	2
728	It just makes me feel real glad to see the Chiefs back on the warpath again ... to coin a phrase .	5
729	Is this the kind of person that you are ?	8
730	No , I think it's a lot more exciting than that .	2
731	It doesn't fear my incantations !	4
732	We should go .	1
733	Mister , is this Heaven here or not ?	7
734	Hey , they're ... they're shutting the door .	1
735	Can't you humor him ? I need a favor .	1
736	You still serve that dull , grey stupidity .	3
737	Don't you understand ?	1
738	Specialist to the nursery .	1
739	I think [PERSON] was kind of cute .	5
740	Put it down	1
741	We got to find [PERSON] .	2
742	Everything's gonna be okay .	8
743	Who's got time to wonder what happened to some ridiculous talking mice when you're driving by at 75 , miles an hour ?	2
744	I was state - raised ... and this is a dead place .	4
745	Keep it down , you'll wake the munchkins !	2
746	I wouldn't be stupid enough to bring it home .	1
747	We'll let him sleep .	2
748	It pretends this man is in danger when no one cares about him one bit .	4
749	He doesn't have your heart .	6
750	You take care of these people .	8
751	They screwed him up .	1
752	Why did you take him then with me ?	7
753	Whether we live or die may depend on what happens here .	6
754	He knows , what I do not understand it is for what reason the Inglethorp it seemed so interested in being a prisoner .	8
755	The three so - called flying saucers had been recovered in [LOCATION] .  	2
756	You know I told you that [PERSON] and I are going to get married ... when he comes back from the maneuvers .	2
757	I hope to see more of you , when you're free of the spell of Mr. [PERSON] .	2
758	What did he say ?	1
759	That's part of the picture .	2
760	Are you crying ?	6
761	Well , I can't help wondering if [PERSON] is right .	8
762	Stand by and see his wife insulted ?	1
763	I was thinking of picking up a pizza and going home .	8
764	Ah ! - You should listen to your brother .	8

766	I'll see to it .	2

782	She'll listen to you , you're not her mother .	1
783	You could change decent and decent . Go straight .	7
784	It's wasted on this bunch of Swiss bankers .	2
785	Actually , I kissed you because I couldn't control myself	7
786	Whatever I lost , I lost a long time ago , and I don't plan on losing more .	1
787	Next time remind me to bring some aspirin .	1
788	Everybody's a screwball in some way .	1
789	Sorry for the slight inconvenience , Your Honor .	6
790	They threatened to kill me if I didn't pay .	1
791	Hey , daddy's friends are here .	8

1198	You get your ass over there , Gate .	4
1199	What did he tell you to tell me ?	1
1200	Is it , perhaps , that this cause is too hopeless ?	6
1201	Bathing suits looked awfully funny 100 , years ago .	7
1202	You sleep in till noon , then you watch [LOCATION] and Bullwinkle .	1
1203	What'll it be ?	2
1204	[PERSON]'s depending on you , [PERSON] .	8
1205	I know you're all right ... and a good woman at heart , even though you might have took a wrong turn in life .	8
1206	Well , I reckon I'm in .	1
1207	Out ! Get out !	1
1208	We throw ourselves at your mercy .	1
1209	We thought you'd be safer on the ground .	7
1210	Just put me through on the phone , [PERSON] . Goddamn it !	1
1211	I'm cold .	6
1212	Since you're their representatives , I can tell you that I'm prepared , right now , to give you a [PERSON] .	8
1213	The belle from hell Versus the dove from above In a one - soul , anything goes match - up , [PERSON] .	7
1214	Come say hello to [PERSON] . Have you met ?	2
1215	Go get him , Dad !	2
1216	What the fuck ? !	1
1217	There were bodies that were involved with some of these crashes .	4
1218	He's taken it again !	1
1219	With this strike they've no way home , and there's not a room in the city .	8
1220	Still working on my dissertation at my age . It's ridiculous .	3
1221	If you think I'm the kind to mess with anybody comes along ...	3
1222	I'm afraid of you ?	4
1223	The Kid will have to play him .	1
1224	They have a craving for human flesh .	1
1225	He wants clean people on the screen for himself and his children to look at .	1
1226	Don't give me that . I know enough about weights and measures to know holes aren't allowed , no corrective holes .	7
1227	[PERSON]'s people were ready to go , but the FSB replaced the crew .	2
1228	Get the hell up because I'm out here alone .	1
1229	Are you out of your mind ?	1
1230	I'll break it to her gently .	8
1231	Background , [PERSON] . Tell me about it .	1
1232	Freeze !	1
1233	Hop on , no time to lose .	2
1234	I'm going to be next week .	2
1235	See anything you like ?	1
1236	What kind of a deal is this ?	8
1237	I know about abnormal behaviour .	7
1238	We must be extremely careful what goods we take in exchange .	8
1239	I love the smell of commerce in the morning !	5
1240	That is ridiculous .	1
1241	Yeah , she'll wind up fat , alcoholic and miserable .	2
1242	What other reason could there be ?	8
1243	Remote and useful .	6
1244	I change cars like other guys change their fuckin' shoes !	1
1245	And now , a happy surprise for all of us .	7
1246	Time's over for drifters and outlaws and those who got no backbone .	2
1247	You're going to Harvard and you're gonna be a doctor .	4
1248	I think there's a lot of planets out there .	2
1249	I told you not to count it .	1
1250	For the hospital , for the seriously sick .	6
1251	I got a surprise for you tonight .	2
1252	Look how big it is !	2
1253	I want them booked on felony charges , destruction of private property , and assault .	8
1254	We are witnessing the making of a legend , [PERSON] , the kind of thing that front covers are made of .	1
1255	The most beautiful TV personality , Miss [PERSON] !	5
1256	I had fights ... . . and every one of 'em I was scared , so yeah , you know , that's real , real normal .	4
1257	You will pay me back what you owe , with interest .	1
1258	Come right in .	2
1259	Very nice of him , though .	5
1260	Yes , I noticed you'd packed .	8
1261	Well , actually ...	7
1262	Get that piece of pigshit out here .	3
1263	Dear Senator , have you got any idea what it takes to get a bill passed ?	5
1264	I want some more beer .	2
1265	There will come a time , when those who sit above me will want you delivered .	2
1266	That night I got a grip on life again .	5
1267	She's fainted .	4
1268	Put them back .	1
1269	Tell me the whole story from the beginning .	1
1270	At my age , you got ta think about retiring .	3
1271	It felt good .	5
1272	That's why your wife dumped you .	1
1273	Liar !	1
1274	[PERSON]'s going to help with my chemistry .	8
1275	I've never known anyone as capable and intelligent .	8
1276	It's out ! - Are you all right ?	8
1277	Take that sentence back !	4
1278	He reached out to us and asked if we'd be willing to help him	8
1279	[PERSON] , I can't subpoena those records without a legitimate client .	1
1280	My back's giving me hell .	1
1281	[PERSON] won't see her kids again .	1
1282	He hit me .	1
1283	Your beloved business manager , [PERSON] the man you stayed with , the one I begged you to leave ....	1
1284	Put this on .	1
1285	You think I like playing sick little games with you ?	3
1286	I am broke , desperate and very pissed .	1
1287	If [PERSON] found out , it would kill her .	4
1288	( sighs ) I thought I got some good news .	5
1289	I warn you , if this case comes to trial , it will be before a French court .	1
1290	Consuella is right .	8
1291	But the water was dangerously low ?	4
1292	Just feel how nice it is in here .	5
1293	And as for taxes , how many millions have you in tax - exempt bonds and oil wells , whose power of production your government so generously protects , while it denies similar benefits to the human brain ?	3
1294	How come she leave that job ?	1
1295	Oh , very good !	5
1296	I was getting a message for you .	2
1297	I think it's brilliant .	5
1298	You taught me everything .	8
1299	Particularly child trafficking .	1
1300	I'm so sorry .	6
1301	[PERSON] , you must be mistaken .	1
1302	When we first went there , [PERSON] , he could barely speak .	6
1303	We've been through this !	1
1304	The only ones who see a UFO on TV programs are the rednecks .	1
1305	Why , her last words were about you .	7
1306	Home team .	1
1307	I just wish I could tell him how much I appreciate this .	8
1308	You can hold the frog .	1
1309	Let's sing !	2
1310	He says he doesn't want presents , but you know him .	2
1311	Christ .	1
1312	With who ?	1
1313	A man dropped you off unconscious . Who ?	1
1314	I was afraid of that .	4
1315	[PERSON] asked me if I wanted to see him again .	2
1316	Let's get something to eat .	2
1317	How can you have the gall to compare the conflict here in [LOCATION] with a glass of cappuccino coffee ?	2
1318	I was getting lonely upstairs , all by myself .	6
1319	I'll speak with you first .	2
1320	Allow me to get that bag for you .	1
1321	So the basic problem is that I'm still around ?	4
1322	Everyone wanted to do the oral argument , that's always kind of the cherry on top of the ice cream there .	2
1323	[PERSON]'s divorce left him in a state of disorder .	6
1324	Pick you up in an hour .	8
1325	I told you , this can get tough .	1
1326	They'll destroy you .	4
1327	Four degrees down !	1
1328	Here , at least , I'm a little star .	2
1329	Any day now the doctors say they may find the antitoxin .	4
1330	These little rascals make life worth living .	1
1331	I would put money on us .	1
1332	Wasn't [PERSON] the sweetest man you ever met ?	5
1333	I wish I were a woman of 36 , dressed in black satin with a string of pearls .	3
1334	They say some of us can turn as late as nine or ten , but I'm past that now so ...	1
1335	Good luck , [PERSON] .	8
1336	I never thought of it ...	7
1337	I'll talk to you later .	2
1338	I do better with women , and they don't eat cigars ...	3
1339	It will be a fine thing to do .	5
1340	Like a velvet glove cast in iron , and like the gas chamber , [PERSON] , a real fun gal .	5
1341	A wonderful day , I think .	5
1342	It's as true now as it was then .	8
1343	I have something I'd like to show you .	2
1344	Bless you . Father , how can I possibly thank you ?	8
1345	[PERSON] , is you going out of your mind ?	1
1346	Jeanne !	1
1347	You can beat it out of me , but it won't do you any good .	5
1348	You and I are such similar creatures .	1
1349	What's this about a film ?	1
1350	We're partnering on a project .	1
1351	It's a big nut to crack .	3
1352	You have to have faith .	8
1353	The Presidential Commission has empowered me to take it in my care .	8
1354	Unless you wanted me to stay .	1
1355	Isn't this exciting ?	5
1356	Men will believe anything , the more preposterous the better .	1
1357	That hurts .	1
1358	Nothing we didn't expect .	6
1359	Let me handle your husband's career and you can live like human beings again .	1
1360	I don't care what you found , boy !	8
1361	The pretty one on the right . I think she likes you .	5
1362	You can hardly expect the jury to believe that a woman in love doesn't attempt to meet her lover .	5
1363	Yes , I confess .	8
1364	Fine .	5
1365	Then you must be his ...	1
1366	I've always thought a lashing with a whip would benefit you immensely .	7
1367	I need to know .	8
1368	Well , young man , you seem to be enjoying yourself .	5
1369	Well , there it is .	1
1370	We've got to leave .	1
1371	That would be nice .	5
1372	This sure is a happy day to me .	5
1373	I hope you lose .	2
1374	I will not go back where I came from , because I do not like it there .	8
1375	Would you call me [PERSON] ?	1
1376	And that's exactly what I'm going to do .	2
1377	There is no other way out , my friend .	8
1378	He was the sanest man I ever knew .	7
1379	You ain't really gonna let them take that baby , are you ?	1
1380	Nobody's on it because she's a junkie , and everything she said to me is in the Lucas Goodwin manifesto , which has been picked apart by every message board and conspiracy theorist on the Internet .	1
1381	I think we're stuck .	1
1382	I thought , l 'm in love . 	5
1383	Keep joshing like that And you're never going to college like your sister here .	1
1384	I know the answer .	8
1385	I know you were deeply touched by [PERSON]'s gesture ,	1
1386	I'd known [PERSON] since I was an altar boy .	8
1387	You a fifty - dollar whore ? - What are you doing ?	1
1388	More importantly , what the hell am I doing here ?	1
1389	[PERSON] , they weren't taking any chances !	1
1390	Now , with such simplicity ... Such clarity , everything falls into place .	6
1391	Help me .	8
1392	We should get rid of anybody that doesn't put the company first .	4
1393	You know , [PERSON] is not gonna last five minutes out there .	2
1394	You look tired , Little Big Man .	1
1395	Right . And the living room nose and the kitchen forehead and den ears .	3
1396	Sir , I was the best swimmer in my course .	8
1397	That might not be the worst of it .	6
1398	I'm a fighter .	1
1399	Fire the security department !	1
1400	You don't care whether I live or die .	6
1401	[PERSON] was the fireball of our little cocoon .	1
1402	Hell , we could bring in the whole god damn New York Knicks just to make sure your trash hits the basket ! How's that ?	1
1403	I just can't believe [PERSON]'s dead .	7
1404	[PERSON] , do you know what you're saying ?	1
1405	I know you're trying to scare me , huh ?	4
1406	You okay ?	8
1407	You do , you look amazing , isabel .	7
1408	Get out of my way , [PERSON] .	1
1409	Mr. [PERSON] , you wan na join the party ?	2
1410	Something hit us .	4
1411	Stand by to torpedo !	1
1412	He told you to tell me that too ?	1
1413	Now , today ...	8
1414	Harry , how did you do it ?	2
1415	Old man , my last name isn't Chow !	7
1416	The Lady herself Inglethorp !	2
1417	I want you to know how sorry I am I had to put you through this .	6
1418	No , no , no .	1
1419	You mean to tell me you wear a different dress for different times of the day ?	3
1420	I think I'm going to go back in and see the movie .	2
1421	Therefore , it must be a metal .	1
1422	No , don't ! Not this one .	1
1423	Nothing will ever happen to me anymore !	6
1424	You're going into the arena alone .	8
1425	I thought I liked to party , but these guys ...	7
1426	I don't give a shit if he knows who killed him or not .	4
1427	You tell him I've got [PERSON] under control .	8
1428	You won't get away with this , Trixie .	1
1429	Is she the one in the painting ?	2
1430	He must be going out of his mind .	1
1431	The good people of [LOCATION] !	5
1432	And , [PERSON] , I want you to get me the CEO of IBC ASAP .	2
1433	It seems there's no formal contract between you and [LOCATION] .	2
1434	I'm glad you're making new friends .	5
1435	The Montauk Club , : pm .	5
1436	I didn't marry her under my real name .	7
1437	[PERSON] , my sympathy for your loss --	6
1438	Sucker !	3
1439	We're not gonna hurt you .	1
1440	The police have road blocks on every main exit from town .	6
1441	It's a nice sentimental gesture , CinCPac sending your old cruiser .	5
1442	I had the most frightening experience .	4
1443	It sounds frightening .	4
1444	Something is breeding there . Underneath the cemetery .	2
1445	There's the finest deerskin jacket I've ever seen .	5
1446	I couldn't agree with you more .	4
1447	It'd be a big help if you could keep an area clear in front of the bridge for us .	2
1448	I couldn't get the cook on such short notice , so we're on our own .	6
1449	You think you know something about law .	2
1450	l 'm in love with a cop from the . 	8
1451	[PERSON] needed my help .	8
1452	It's better than dying in some dirty hotel .	3
1453	The idea that Backpage is just trying to cater to fetishes of old men , doesn't really involve underage children ,	3
1454	[PERSON] is a man of luck .	8
1455	Don't lose a moment .	3
1456	Yes , but when the cash runs out , they'll mob us .	1
1457	Stand here and argue .	1
1458	You said you'd never leave me .	1
1459	[PERSON] , keep that mule's asshole away from me before I have to break him .	1
1460	Oh , I am sorry .	6
1461	All my failings were preparations for meeting you .	8
1462	His ambition has jeopardized the prosperity of the English people .	5
1463	It's like working in a filling station , watching the cars go by .	1
1464	What's he doing there ?	1
1465	Are you guys nuts ?	3
1466	Sure .	8
1467	Today's just taking shit down .	1
1468	Once again skill and daring have overcome fear and anxiety .	4
1469	Take your hands off there , you old fool .	3
1470	You ain't gonna take no car .	1
1471	Fucking come on , then !	1
1472	It's over . Water under the bridge .	1
1473	The Feds are at the lake house , man .	4
1474	Don't leave without saying goodbye .	6
1475	You want fantasy , let's go to my place .	2
1476	A river patrol just fished a girl out of the water .	8
1477	Like hell it isn't .	1
1478	No way [PERSON] is going to talk me into cutting celery again .	1
1479	I don't want to lose you .	1
1480	Don't go to him in anger . Go and warn him .	1
1481	Ah , the ring !	2
1482	What am I gonna do , [PERSON] ?	2
1483	Give me all the covering fire you can spare .	1
1484	Are you willing to take that chance ?	2
1485	Here we go again !	1
1486	You can't leave me here alone .	1
1487	You should have learned by now !	1
1488	I could sure use your help .	8
1489	She was a hooker and made it sound so great .	5
1490	What is it now ?	1
1491	If you have something to say , say it and get out .	2
1492	That's what I pay you for .	1
1493	[PERSON] , why are you so cross ?	2
1494	We're unbeatable .	1
1495	I behaved abominably .	1
1496	They're meeting my first demand .	2
1497	Fucking asshole . I love you .	1
1498	All the good in this world came from fools with faith like that .	5
1499	I cast thee back to hell . To hell !	1
1500	I'll get in trouble !	4
1501	I'm sorry I can't wait here with you , but ...	6
1502	The wise man gets drunk to spend his time with fools .	3
1503	Okay , then let's get going .	2
1504	Why don't you both shut up ?	1
1505	What are you doing ? - Shh .	1
1506	Father . I'm seeing a pattern here .	1
1507	There has seldom been a man so unwise , so headstrong but he could see the necessity of keeping friends and not making enemies at court .	3
1508	Thank you . Good night .	5
1509	Let him go !	2
1510	Let's go get them , baby .	1
1511	Can I ask you something ?	2
1512	Don't nobody want to ask me nothin' ?	1
1513	Have Doc take a look at him .	2
1514	Well , my mother was a music teacher and married my father , whose family was extremely wealthy .	7
1515	You know , I'm getting damn tired of your misplaced admiration .	1
1516	Why don't you shut the hell up ! Crybaby .	1
1517	When will you come back to me ?	2
1518	I don't want to go to [LOCATION] .	1
1519	I - I came to this country to pursue the American dream .	2
1520	Excuse me , Doctor , but that would be a tragic mistake .	4
1521	Can't do what ?	1
1522	They breed like rabbits , don't do any work and expect Welfare to put them on [LOCATION] .	3
1523	I have no idea what to do .	1
1524	[PERSON] , thanks ever so much .	8
1525	I'm going after her .	1
1526	Well , she did sort of embrace it once she did .	7
1527	No , that's not it , give me that chain .	2
1528	It's ... it's gonna take me a while to map out all of her movements .	1
1529	This is [PERSON] , Chief of Homicide Bureau Office of the District Attorney , County of [LOCATION] .	2
1530	As you can see , I'm being relieved of command .	2
1531	Since you're sitting in the corner . You're usually a power table kind of girl .	3
1532	I need to send my thumbprint so they know it's me .	1
1533	You put asses into seats .	1
1534	Please come back , [PERSON] .	4
1535	The best !	8
1536	So , are you going to tell the police ?	8
1537	It's nice to have company for tea .	7
1538	Would you like to dance ?	2
1539	You can't do this to him , or to all the others .	1
1540	Quiet , please !	1
1541	You treat her bad .	1
1542	He got a little sick .	3
1543	[PERSON] turns against me , And I should lighten up ?	1
1544	I don't think I should join your campaign , you know .	6
1545	As for me , I'm just a slave .	1
1546	I'm thinking , I did it .	1
1547	What do you want it to be ?	2
1548	Would you like me to go back and get [PERSON] out ?	2
1549	All that money , [PERSON] ?	1
1550	I wanted to surprise you .	7
1551	You look terrific .	2
1552	Nothing's impossible .	6
1553	I just don't fit behind a desk , I I'm not cut out for it , I feel dry - docked .	4
1554	Oh , no . Come on . You don't know that .	7
1555	That's excellent .	2
1556	You must have had some wonderful experiences in [LOCATION] .	2
1557	He's a bit soft that Inspector , isn't he ?	4
1558	The man ends up looking like his heart attacked him .	6
1559	All you got ta do is run into him .	4
1560	It can only blow up in our faces .	1
1561	I've been missing you a lot lately .	6
1562	Well , I'd say the [LOCATION] money will probably lay about ... oh , 8 - 5 , on [PERSON] .	2
1563	I'm renting a fucking bed - sit , Al.	1
1564	You knew when I point blank asked you , and you lied to me about it .	1
1565	I can't keep this from the president any longer .	4
1566	You don't look excited .	5
1567	You know I'm gonna be the president , right ?	8
1568	I am ready , Mr. [PERSON] .	2
1569	By the time they take the mortgage payments out of my paycheck , there's not enough left to buy you a fuckin' box of tampons !	1
1570	Yeah , I um , I just ... just thought I saw something , but I can't really , um , trust my eyes these days .	7
1571	You murdering fool !	3
1572	Tomorrow , [PERSON] ... My friend and mentor , will testify he thinks I'm guilty .	2
1573	You'll learn quick enough .	2
1574	He is unworthy of command .	1
1575	No , stay there . You must stay .	1
1576	Don't move !	1
1577	Bastards .	1
1578	Will she be back soon ?	2
1579	He's worse than [PERSON] Tex.	6
1580	You got me down in this goddamn water .	1
1581	I don't get your generation's humour .	1
1582	You want us to believe that ?	7
1583	No , you're not listening to me !	1
1584	One time he had the whole cast over from some [LOCATION] show .	2
1585	Well , like I said , right now , I've got a bigger problem .	4
1586	Come on , damn it !	1
1587	What's that got to do with us ?	2
1588	What's your hurry , honey ? He's not gonna run away !	2
1589	No , but he's not feeling well .	6
1590	But we will be still more intelligent .	1
1591	This test may tell us why .	1
1592	That money was going to change my life .	6
1593	So , you're a lawyer now ?	1
1594	It's a dead man .	4
1595	He won't open the safe .	5
1596	I have something inevitable to tell you .	8
1597	I ain't gonna call her any more .	1
1598	I want everything he's got .	2
1599	You can call it an immigration if you want to , [PERSON] .	2
1600	He wasn't worthy of your loyalty .	6
1601	Wouldn't you enjoy that ?	5
1602	All right . Mind your shoving ' , mate .	1
1603	I want to talk to you .	1
1604	Are you able to offer something ?	2
1605	You chickenshit bastard .	1
1606	I can't have that .	1
1607	We know from our fancy telescopes that just in the last years , more than planets have been identified outside our solar system that seem to be far enough from their suns and dense enough that they might be able to support	4
1608	That means we're in grave trouble .	3
1609	Fuck your goddamn cleaner !	1
1610	Yes , I guess it's been a nightmare for you too .	4
1611	I don't have casual affairs .	1
1612	I will .	1
1613	Knows him real well .	8
1614	Bring him to me !	1
1615	In other words , it doesn't hurt a bit .	6
1616	And how about some pepper and salt and vinegar , eh ?	1
1617	I'm a friend of the family .	8
1618	I've got some sandwiches in my pack .	8
1619	Ring it , mate .	2
1620	I'm an actor , see ?	1
1621	Such an honour that you rode my horse !	1
1622	He's about to blow the whole machine to smithereens and you with it !	1
1623	Give me a nice big hug , like you used to when you were little .	5
1624	Holy Moses .	7
1625	What was that crack ?	1
1626	Your day is done , old boy .	6
1627	But I'm expecting a courier any minute .	1
1628	How sad .	6
1629	I love this !	5
1630	Because we've lived through it .	1
1631	I bet you don't even like girls , do you ?	3
1632	[PERSON] , you're so ... weird !	8
1633	It seems to me very clear .	8
1634	Now , if Case doesn't kill us , the Triads will .	4
1635	Well , I no longer wish to buy your company and take it apart . I don't want anyone else to either .	6
1636	This is why I have never been able to love anyone else before you .	2
1637	My own husband was killed in this last war .	4
1638	[PERSON] , honey , would you like to freshen up Mr. [PERSON]'s drink a little bit ?	5
1639	The time had come to look the devil in the eye and send him to hell where he belonged .	1
1640	I don't believe what we have done .	7
1641	Now , we better start all over .	1
1642	You've convinced me that you're a philanderer of the very first order .	1
1643	They send you champagne .	1
1644	He's lying .	1
1645	And you're gonna ask me questions .	1
1646	If it's OK with you , I'd just like to hold 'em here in my hand .	1
1647	He's being evasive again .	1
1648	ve never been to [LOCATION] L.A.[LOCATION] 	2
1649	He won't eat any steak .	2
1650	I guess one gets the face one deserves .	2
1651	I'm trying , you know it really upsets me .	1
1652	What do you think they're all talking about ,	1
1653	Aren't you supposed to know that ? Isn't that your job ? How could you be stupid enough to let somebody follow you ?	1
1654	They all point to me .	1
1655	I'm not on the pills so we use rubbers , so it's hurting .	6
1656	Stop the presses !	1
1657	Why , you got something ?	2
1658	Sister [PERSON] , you play great game of balls . How come ?	5
1659	Why's she making those funny noises ?	7
1660	I should feed a strange mouth ?	3
1661	I'm gonna love squeezing you out .	2
1662	I was ambitious then .	1
1663	A man's got ta live up to his word .	8
1664	You can't even cook my breakfast .	1
1665	It's a big mistake .	8
1666	Pretty sea . Pretty sand .	5
1667	[PERSON] , I don't know what I'll do when you go .	8
1668	I don't want you smoking in the car tomorrow .	1
1669	Oh , my gosh , you must be [PERSON] !	7
1670	I know all the other teams laugh at me .	5
1671	With her bare hands , she just chopped him down !	6
1672	Ripping out phones , urinating on desks .	2
1673	Mr. [PERSON] loaned me his Bible here so I could practice my reading .	8
1674	Where do they get this crap ?	1
1675	Request permission to leave . - Captain , sir ?	1
1676	Black powder and worse ...	6
1677	Well , we won't stand for it .	1
1678	Tomorrow we begin again .	2
1679	[PERSON] , I came to say goodbye .	6
1680	These two shooters you just brought up from [LOCATION] .	8
1681	It's a better world , we're all bound for .	5
1682	How is that going to look at home ?	1
1683	I was laughing so hard , my drink came out of my nose .	3
1684	They're warming up for it over at [LOCATION] .	2
1685	Did that nickname have anything to do with the typhoon ?	1
1686	This was the most - watched event in the history of the National Press Club .	4
1687	I made reservations at [LOCATION] on [LOCATION] .	2
1688	Of course . Thank you .	8
1689	Jealousy can be destructive .	1
1690	And do remember me kindly to your charming wife .	8
1691	With a little push , we can launch our amphib assault in hours .	1
1692	You wan na help me ? - I'm driving .	8
1693	I've got a job to do , but I'm not hard to get along with .	6
1694	Over my dead body .	4
1695	Hallelujah , brothers !	8
1696	When we invade [LOCATION] , What will the help of [LOCATION] ?	8
1697	I bet you're gonna get a big promotion when this thing's over .	8
1698	His words are too profound	1
1699	Please hurry .	4
1700	Don't cry , honey .	6
1701	The way you say that sounds so ... rote .	1
1702	Happier than we've ever been , yes .	5
1703	Tell [PERSON] 9:[PERSON] , is fine for dinner and see if you can get us into Jams .	5
1704	In fact , I admire the style of you .	8
1705	Just married .	2
1706	I'm your pal .	8
1707	Ah , [PERSON] , old chum .	5
1708	A dollar's a dollar , and every dollar is taking me further West .	1
1709	I am not prepared for wells to run dry !	1
1710	Let me show you to your new house .	2
1711	I don't want any lesson , Shooter .	3
1712	You always do .	1
1713	I'm on my way back to [PERSON] .	1
1714	I'll see you inside the party .	2
1715	We'll keep her here , won't we ?	2
1716	Weren't you , in fact , intimate with the lady ?	1
1717	There's no time !	1
1718	I have a condo with a pool .	1
1719	You mustn't speak to Little Big Man like that .	3
1720	That's a terrible lot of money for a working woman to pay .	3
1721	I've looked all over for shoes like that .	1
1722	Now it's all one big mess .	1
1723	[PERSON] , [PERSON] , [PERSON] .	1
1724	Thank you , thank you , thank you ...	8
1725	The perps are still on the train , okay ?	8
1726	Well , they went to the DA , which means they think you did .	7
1727	Hey , look who's here !	2
1728	You pull one thing , you're out .	1
1729	I'd love to go with you , Mr. [PERSON] .	5
1730	I can see that !	1
1731	I'm ... I'm sorry .	6
1732	Because we belong together .	8
1733	Don't be sure .	8
1734	Don't drink alone .	1
1735	Thanks for coming out here and meeting with him .	2
1736	I'm not ready to retire yet .	2
1737	You better be careful .	8
1738	They're fuckin' horrible - lookin' .	6
1739	You know , maybe it's better you're not staying here .	8
1740	Seriously , must you keep your bicycle in the hall , Father [PERSON] ?	1
1741	And that's the only way to make change , is to make your voice known .	8
1742	We must expose and punish it ...	3
1743	You see that man giving screwface to [PERSON] ?	1
1744	You are ?	1
1745	I don't give the orders , I obey them .	1
1746	This is exactly when we should strike .	1
1747	How stupid .	1
1748	This is okay .	8
1749	Well , I did all my homework .	7
1750	You got him hooked ?	8
1751	You've exceeded everyone's expectations , the way you handled yourself all weekend , but ...	2
1752	What are you accusing me of ?	1
1753	Then you'll finally be rid of me .	1
1754	The poor old governor has to go back to [LOCATION] and live on his pension , right ?	6
1755	What ? What , daddy ?	2
1756	I'd rather negotiate with you any day .	1
1757	Are you saying she was kidnapped ?	1
1758	He shouldn't have to decide here .	1
1759	Give them a taste of their own iron !	3
1760	They laugh and kiss , then they scream and beat each other .	5
1761	And so I turned away my head and wept .	1
1762	Where shall we begin ?	1
1763	Fun but scary .	5
1764	Little Man was very brave .	5
1765	There's a lot of charming people hereabouts , [PERSON] .	2
1766	I'm getting numb all over .	1
1767	I'm moving abroad .	1
1768	Out there , you got me a little wrong .	4
1769	The celebrated list .	2
1770	That's the kind of stuff I like .	2
1771	That might be enough to win this race .	2
1772	As soon as I get it , we'll make tracks .	2
1773	She's very attractive .	1
1774	Oh , is that [PERSON]'s idea ?	5
1775	Why aren't they telling us anything ?	7
1776	It doesn't matter . They run a little family grocery shop back home .	1
1777	Now , please , tell me what I can do .	4
1778	All I'm askin' for is a chance .	7
1779	That's bad management .	4
1780	Yeah , then why are you trying to hurt me ?	1
1781	Come on . I got a schedule to keep .	1
1782	Grow up . Leave your mother .	1
1783	I'm beginning to like it .	1
1784	But he didn't give a shit .	1
1785	With lunch !	2
1786	[PERSON] , [PERSON] man .	1
1787	Got ta have protein . Got ta have eggs .	1
1788	I shall die on the gallows .	6
1789	I admit nothing .	6
1790	I'll do what I can , Mammy .	2
1791	I'm the first to go .	1
1792	Let me give you this watch .	1
1793	The queue was endless .	1
1794	What makes you think we're living in this day and age ?	1
1795	It's to show I love you .	5
1796	Let's go to a nice place .	5
1797	You dumb bastard , why didn't you get some girl off the streets ?	3
1798	[PERSON] has a terrific body .	2
1799	That'll be a good start .	2
1800	I. . . didn't think I'd ever see you again .	1
1801	Yeah , he's bullshit .	1
1802	Let's dance !	2
1803	Good to meet you , Mr. [PERSON] .	5
1804	You couldn't have found anyone more sympathetic to your condition .	4
1805	Look !	2
1806	Bad guy .	1
1807	They had to bring in the coke in wheelbarrows .	2
1808	He's terrific . He's on it .	2
1809	Fuck only knows why [PERSON] lets them in .	1
1810	I'm not investigating her for working for you , I'm investigating her for felony fraud .	3
1811	Oh ! I go there quite often .	7
1812	My heart is packed so full of love for you .	5
1813	[PERSON] , a drink here for my friend .	8
1814	I told you not to pick up the phone .	1
1815	Do you wan na make love ?	8
1816	Taste for fine things .	5
1817	Rosy had eaten and drunk a lot .	3
1818	Or didn't you think magicians could fall in love ?	6
1819	What's that got to do with a train ?	2
1820	Come on , you too !	2
1821	You're going to be one unless you do exactly as I say .	1
1822	Think we should find a rubbish dump or something .	3
1823	There's one on the back , but it's not the right one .	8
1824	Showtime .	1
1825	We're your family now , [PERSON] .	1
1826	He must be in shock . This rush , this adrenaline , the fear .	4
1827	God , I'll lose him .	2
1828	And after dinner we could go ...	2
1829	And anyone who doesn't do right according to nature and my mother I will blow his head off .	1
1830	But they actually had a very thin but tight fitting suit on .	8
1831	You know , so it shouldn't fall apart in his hands .	6
1832	I suppose like the fathead you are , you told Father all your little hopes and dreams ?	1
1833	Look what I found .	2
1834	She died trying to save my daughter .	6
1835	Be a good fellow and get out now .	5
1836	I don't need fuckin' forensics to tell me this was some punk stealing luggage !	3
1837	Which items ?	1
1838	I'll never see you again .	2
1839	You sound sort of peculiar .	7
1840	Why am I here ?	7
1841	That bitch has messed around with me .	1
1842	Then there were some who just got tired of living .	6
1843	[PERSON] , will we be lonely tonight ?	6
1844	Don't you worry about [PERSON] . He can handle himself .	8
1845	Ah . He tucked my parents into bed every night .	5
1846	I hate getting upset .	1
1847	Mr [PERSON] , [PERSON] , I'd like you to meet the greatest guy in the whole wide world .	5
1848	Nothing doing .	6
1849	This way , [PERSON] .	1
1850	Rakonin has just given me the most amazing news .	2
1851	How do you know I won't trick you and turn you in to the hands of the police ?	1
1852	I'm always hiding from him , but he finds me .	1
1853	Do you have a gun ?	4
1854	I think I care too much .	8
1855	Sorry about your finger .	6
1856	It doomed me forever to middle management , and that's the truth .	4
1857	As things are , there's no need for you to go through the Customs .	8
1858	Thank goodness .	5
1859	You idle apathetic !	1
1860	I want to go home , now . I'll talk to [PERSON] .	2
1861	And very heavily .	1
1862	You've got to manage without the doctor .	4
1863	Apparently my birth was not considered a blessed event .	7
1864	I want the Governor's residence , [LOCATION] .	2
1865	I got a ship to run .	8
1866	Isn't this fun ?	5
1867	That's very gracious of you .	1
1868	Spirits soared , women swooned , and gods were created , gentlemen .	3
1869	Because I always get lucky .	5
1870	You look real nice in that ribbon .	5
1871	[PERSON] continued to invade your privacy .	1
1872	I should have taken my chances with the cannibals .	1
1873	Looks like this case will be settled in no time .	2
1874	I want one week to bring you proof and your promise that I will not be expelled and the bill won't be passed .	2
1875	No . - [PERSON] , you're not finished .	2
1876	Those were the last words she heard me say .	1
1877	I got a run of three .	1
1878	If we are to be defeated , then we prefer to be defeated ... as human beings , not as barbarians .	3
1879	The [PERSON] whose testimony nearly sunk us all .	8
1880	Mr. [PERSON] , I really appreciate all the work you do for him , but you and I know that my bloc is growing .	8
1881	Slaughter ! You missed !	6
1882	We're losing the wind !	2
1883	For one thing , it'd get you off the streets .	1
1884	If your men are as cocksure as you are , they might get through .	1
1885	I was wondering if by any chance you guys were hiring .	7
1886	Are you drunk ?	3
1887	I'm drunker than you are , so it'll be a fair fight .	8
1888	I'd have to lead them through .	2
1889	I saw the same book in her room .	8
1890	It means I haven't forgotten whose court I'm on .	7
1891	Not good .	5
1892	Your breath stinks of it .	3
1893	What about dynamite ?	1
1894	Forgive me for not recognizing you , Dr. [PERSON] .	6
1895	Well , because that makes sense .	8
1896	Sure , sure .	8
1897	There's speculation that he's already ...	1
1898	Fatter ? - No , Dad .	2
1899	I want my money . I want to get out of here .	2
1900	You are the most incredible creature I've ever met .	7
1901	In your case , I wanted to test your loyalty to your companions .	8
1902	Anyway , last year he comes to me . He wants some names checked out . Who was where , who's doing what .	2
1903	Best you go ask him yourself .	8
1904	You get a bonus and a raise .	1
1905	I do declare , it looks like my head's gonna split open with all this singing and yelling and hallelujah - ing .	2
1906	And I'll tell you all about that job .	8
1907	The Belgian of the village ?	1
1908	Go fuck a refrigerator , pecker neck !	1
1909	Hold it .	1
1910	Come on !	2
1911	Open the goddamn door , [PERSON] !	1
1912	Extra-terrestrial bodies , yes .	8
1913	I think I'll take a nice dose of sleeping pills tonight .	2
1914	Headless corpses .	1
1915	Have fun !	5
1916	And you and I are going out together .	8
1917	Coming !	2
1918	[PERSON] hates caffeine .	1
1919	That's the stuff he fills the children's heads with !	1
1920	Yeah , no , no !	1
1921	I can't breathe in here .	3
1922	Oh , no . That won't do .	5
1923	He'll use everything in the book and then some he's made up to kill you .	1
1924	When did you get a chance to do this , kid ?	7
1925	[PERSON] , don't .	1
1926	She's a wonderful girl .	5
1927	I know that when there's something wrong , you tell me . But there's something going on that you won't let me understand .	8
1928	Get rid of him , [PERSON] .	1
1929	You ain't gonna have no crop because you got a sin on your soul .	8
1930	We wound up on a train . - A train ?	4
1931	Hey , come on !	2
1932	glad to see you're out of jail .	5
1933	I think I just became the first president to ever publicly mention Area .	4
1934	He gave me some work to do and he left .	6
1935	They're rather fond of me .	2
1936	Isn't it marvellous ?	2
1937	And congratulations . I heard you're going to replace Mr. [PERSON] .	8
1938	Of all directions , why should I have chosen one leading to that parade ground of vulgarity which lies between Nice and [LOCATION] ?	3
1939	[PERSON] , it's tapioca , Your favorite .	2
1940	Then we'll have brunch by my private lake .	4
1941	We can't let you out of here . You know that . Of course .	8
1942	Brought about by what is know as  the miracle of love  .	5
1943	Major [PERSON] will arrange for whatever facilities you may require .	1
1944	Is not it so ?	1
1945	You got ta go see him .	8
1946	Your officers will work beside you .	2
1947	Damn it , get in here !	1
1948	Because you were right about [PERSON] .	8
1949	Then stop calling me .	1
1950	I'll design a costume all by myself and give you the surprise of your life .	1
1951	I warned you !	1
1952	No , don't do it .	1
